We will conduct further robustness checks by transforming the dependent variable to eliminate some of the skewness. One of the things we have noticed is the large number of fixed effects this paper uses for a small n (n=49). We might check for a more parsimonius model and if these fixed effects are all necessary, and to evaluate how few observations can be dropped before the effect disappears.\n\n\\include{table_2_replication}\n\n\\include{table_3_replication}\n\n\\include{table_4_replication}\n\n\\include{table_5_replication}\n\n\\include{table_6_replication}\n\n\\include{table_7_replication}\n",
