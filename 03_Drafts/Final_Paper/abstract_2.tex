This paper extends the analysis in Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014) to show that historical conflict in Africa may have persistent effects on individual levels of trust and identity, but that the relationship between historical conflict and present-day economic development is less clear. The authors argue that precolonial conflict in Africa is associated with higher levels of cross-country postcolonial conflict, lower levels of sub-national trust and national identity, and higher levels of ethnic identity, and lower levels of sub-national economic development. We improve on their results by detecting key heterogeneities in the data, which point to certain institutional mechanisms through which their findings operate. We find supporting evidence for their second finding when removing post-treatment covariates, but find less support for their third finding and argue that the post-treatment covariates may have introduced unknown biases into their predictions. We conclude by placing their findings about trust and identity in the greater context of social fabric in these societies, and argue that historical conflict may cause uniformly lower levels of trust, not just lower levels of trust among rival ethnic groups.
