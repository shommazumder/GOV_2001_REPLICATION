#Introduction
This directory contains all of the necessary datasets and R scripts to replicate the analysis in Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014) as well as Bowles, Bullock, and Mazumder (2016). To replicate the results, we recommend that you use RStudio. If you have any questions, please contact either Jeremy Bowles (jbowles[at]g.harvard.edu), Jessie Bullock (jbullock[at]g.harvard.edu), or Shom Mazumder (smazumder[at]g.harvard.edu).

#Instructions

Note: All directory structures and file paths are with reference to the main replication directory. To ensure that there are no file path issues, please use the "GOV_2001_REPLICATION.rproj" file in RStudio. 

##Replicating Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014)

(1) Navigate to the main directory titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION/"
(2) Open up the file titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION.rproj" in RStudio
(3) Within RStudio, vavigate to the directory titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION/02_Analysis/Replication/"
(4) Run the script titled "batch_replicate_tables.R"

To replicate individual tables in Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014), simply open up the R script for the relevant table 'table_x.r' you wish to replicate and run that script in RStudio.

##Replicating Bowles, Bullock, and Mazumder (2016)

(1) Navigate to the main directory titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION/"
(2) Open up the file titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION.rproj" in RStudio
(3) Within RStudio, vavigate to the directory titled "GOV_2001_REPLICATION/02_Analysis/Final_Paper/"
(4) Run the script titled "batch.R"

To replicate specific analyses in the research note, navigate to the relevant directory within "GOV_2001_REPLICATION/02_Analysis/Final_Paper/" and run the individual R script associated with each empirical section.
